# TextMate/Sublime Text plugin for Varnish

While working on my presentation for the [Varnish <3 release party](http://varnish-release-party-milano.eventbrite.com/) I finally got tired of staring at a file in TextMate with no syntax highlighing, no symbol reference and no folding. Thus this plugin was born.

This is still very much a work in progress; I'm sure there are plenty of bugs. Pull requests are very welcome!
